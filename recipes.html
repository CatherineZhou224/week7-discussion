        <p>
          My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at
          Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her
          siblings. They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.
          Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.

        <p>
          Unlike Indian or Thai curry, Japanese curry is more savory than spicy.
          It’s an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked
          dishes in Japan.
        </p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
          <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper</li>
          <li>water</li>
          <li>1 package curry sauce mix</li>
          <li>1 can peas</li>
          <li>5 new potatoes, halved</li>
          <li>1 package sliced cremini mushrooms</li>
          <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
          <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
          <li>2 cups jasmine rice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Place chicken in a large, deep skillet. Drizzle with olive oil and
            season with salt and pepper on both sides. Add 1/3 cup water to the
            pan, cover, and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in the
            center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            While chicken is cooking, pour 2 cups water into a microwave-safe
            bowl. Break curry sauce mix into pieces and add to water. Heat in
            the microwave on high for 3 1/2 minutes; remove and stir until sauce
            mix has completely dissolved.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove chicken from the skillet. Cut into cubes, return to the
            skillet, and pour curry sauce over top. Stir in peas, potatoes,
            mushrooms, carrots, and onion. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and
            simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, bring remaining water and rice to a boil in a saucepan.
            Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender
            and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Scoop rice into bowls and serve curry on top.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          I learnt how to cook Coca-Cola chicken wings from my mother, and I've
          since tweaked her recipe to better suit my family's palate, making it
          less sweet. While the cooking process remains straightforward, the
          result is incredibly flavorful, and once you've tried it, you'll
          understand its delicious appeal!

          <li>
            Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate the chicken wings for
            1 hour
          </li>
          <li>
            Put the right amount of oil in the pot, and put the marinated
            chicken wings into the pot and fry it until golden brown on both
            sides
          </li>
          <li>
            After fry the chicken wings until golden brown on both sides, then
            pour a can of coke into the pan and bring to a boil
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue to cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the glaze has
            thickened and coats the wings nicely
